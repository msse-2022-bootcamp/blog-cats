Hello all, in this blog post I will take the opportunity to introduce you to my colleage Chongye Feng, who also goes by the nickname Aaron. Chongye is from the Guangong province in China and studied Chemistry at St. Cloud university in Minnesota, USA. He currently lives in Albany, California while working on the MSSE degree. 

Chongye has told me that he enjoys playing badminton and he likes to eat shrimp as well as other shellfish like lobster. He is a fan of the show Top Gear, and has been recently watching the second rendition of the show which is now hosted on Amazon prime. His favorite esports team is Invictus gaming who won the 2018 S9 League of Legends championship. This is something we have in common, we both like to watch video games at the professional level.

As far as a career is concerned, Chongye is like many of us in that he wishes to leverage his knowledge of chemistry while learning the best practices in software development in order to make a difference in the world. This is something I have in common with him, that we are both here to learn how to bring our knowledge to the area of computing in chemistry.

From my experience chatting with Chongye and working on this first assignment together I have learned that he is very respectful and will undoubtably be a helpful member of our MSSE cohort and I look forward to working with him in the future.
